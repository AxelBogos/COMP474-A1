As such, it \n\nhas evolved from a specialized computer application to a central component \n\nof a modern computing environment. In this course, we study fundamental \n\nconcepts and techniques of database management, focusing more on \n\ndatabase design and programming aspects in particular for relational data. \n\nTextbook: J.D. Ullman and J. Widom. A First Course in Database Systems,  \n\nPrentice Hall, 3rd edition, 2008. \n\nReference: A. Silberschatz, H.F. Korth, and S. Sudershan, Database System \nConcepts, 6\n\nth\n Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2011. \n\nLecture notes, assignments, projects, and other related materials are (or will \n\nbe made) available on moodle. \n\nCourse Description: In this first course in databases, we study concepts and \n\ntechniques of database design and programming. We begin with basics of \n\nthe SQL DB language followed by the entity-relationship (E/R) design \n\nnotation and methodology. We will then introduce functional dependencies \n\n(FD\xe2\x80\x99s) and normalization theory for relational database design. We study \n\n\n\ndatabase query languages and focus on relational algebra, Datalog, and \n\nODL. We return to SQL and learn how to express transactions, views, and \n\nvarious types of integrity constraints, including checks, assertions, and \n\ntriggers. \n\nLecture notes, assignments, projects, and other course related materials and \n\nimportant announcements will be posted on Moodle. Please check out the \n\n\xe2\x80\x9dImportant Dates\xe2\x80\x9d on moodle for a calendar of the course and the due dates. \n\nGrading Scheme: The course components and associated grade \n\ndistributions are as follows.  \n\nComponents  %   \n\nAssignments (4) 16 \n\nProjects (2) 24 \n\nQuizzes (5) 10 \n\nMidterm 20 \n\nFinal 30 \n\nImportant note: To pass the course, you need to obtain a passing grade in \n\nthe projects, the midterm, the final exam, and the total percentage. A passing \n\ngrade is normally 50%. Also note that there is no priori fixed relationship \n\nbetween the total percentage and the final letter grade assigned, except that a \n\nhigher percentage is normally assigned a better letter grade. \n\n  \n\n\n\nCourse Components (Details): \n\n1. Assignments: There will be 4 assignments of equal weights. While \nwe encourage discussion of course works with fellow students, each \n\nstudent should write his/her solutions to assignments individually and \n\nindependently. Note that all the course related works, including \n\nsolutions to assignments and project reports, should be submitted \n\nthrough Moodle only. \n\n2. Quizzes: There will be 5 pop-up quizzes, each worth 2 points. You \nget 1 for participation in each quiz and 1 for correct answers. \n\n3. Exams: There will be a midterm and a final exam. The midterm will \nbe during the lecture at a defined date later, and the final will be 3 \n\nhours and scheduled by the Exam office.  \n\nAll students are expected to have access to the internet and hardware \n\nequipments (computer, webcam, microphone). Also, students are \n\nexpected to have the ability to do online timed exams. \n\n4. Projects: There will be projects, called Warm-up (6 points) and Main \n(18 points), explained as follows. \n\na) The Warm-up Project: You will be given a database design \ntogether with some queries and transactions for an application \n\nwhich you need to implement and report the results. You will \n\nbe provided access to the MySQL database management system \n\n(DBMS) maintained by the faculty AITS. \n\nb) The Main Project: You and your team are required to design a \ndatabase for a \xe2\x80\x9drealistic\xe2\x80\x9d application and implement the system \n\nin MYSQL. Your project report should include details of your \n\ndesign steps from the E/R diagram to the refined and \n\nnormalized relations. You also need to develop a suitable user \n\ninterface to facilitate expressing and executing queries and \n\ntransactions against the database. This would be a two-layer, \n\nweb-based system using a standard web browser at the client \n\nside. The application uses an http server with PHP parser to \n\ncommunicate with the database server. The system is expected \n\nto support \xe2\x80\x9crepresentative\xe2\x80\x9d queries and transactions efficiently. \n\nIn addition to details of your database design and normalization \n\nsteps, you project report should include queries and transactions \n\nexpressed against the database and the results produced, it \n\n\n\nshould also include the test data and the SQL scripts developed \n\nand used for creating and loading the data in the database. \n\nc) Teams: Projects are done in teams, each consisting of exactly 4 \nstudents. While each team member takes part in a well defined \n\nportion of the project, the entire team is responsible for their \n\nproject. Each team picks one of the members as the \n\nrepresentative to coordinate project-related activities and \n\ncommunications. No later than July 8th, the team representative \n\nshould send an email to stan@encs.concordia.ca with the \n\nfollowing information about the members: First name and Last \n\nname, student ID, and the ENCS email account. Also, please \n\nprovide a \xe2\x80\x9dpassword\xe2\x80\x9d consisting of 8 alpha-numeric characters. \n\nThis password is used to access your database in MySQL, and \n\nshould be shared only by the team members to protect your \n\ndatabase. \n\nd) Project reports and demos: The final project reports are all due \non Thursday August 5th at 13:00. Late submission may not be \n\ngranted. The demo dates for the main project will be during the \n\nlab hours on August 5th. Each team will have 15 minutes to \n\ndemonstrate their working database application system. A \n\nschedule for project demos will be posted at the course web \n\npage. \n\nGraduate Attributes: As part of the curriculum for Computer Science and \n\nSoftware Engineering programs, COMP353 includes materials and exercises \n\nrelated to a number of graduate attributes, which include knowledge and \n\nskills identified by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) \n\nand the Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS) as being central to \n\nthe formation of engineers, computer scientists, and information technology \n\nprofessionals. In this regard, the learning objectives of this course are as \n\nfollows. \n\nLearning Objectives: \n\n(1) Knowledge base. Conceptual database design: the entity-relationship \nmodel; the relational data model and relational algebra: functional \n\ndependencies and normalization; the SQL database language for \n\nformulating queries and transactions against databases; integrity \n\nconstraints and triggers; other data models and languages: Datalog and \n\nODL. \n\n\n\n(2) Design: Develop applications that require elaborated database \ncomponents. \n\n(3) Use of tools: Use of DBMS, database adapters, and use of the PHP \nscripting language to develop web-based database application systems. \n\n(4) Team projects: Team work on development of a web-based application \nthat requires an elaborated database component. \n\nAdditional Notes: \n\na) Backups: It is highly recommended to make proper backups of all your \nindividual and team works during the semester until the final grades are \n\npublished. \n\nb) Academic Integrity: It is important to be aware and observe the \nacademic integrity and code of conduct. See details in the link provided \n\nat the course web page. \n\nc) Final Advice: We encourage a collaborative learning in this course, as \ntogether we learn more and better. As a closing remark, we recommend \n\nto start working on the course materials, assignments, and projects as \n\nearly as possible! \n\nTogether with my assistants in this course, we wish you all a successful \n\nsemester ahead.  \n\nKhaled Jababo \n\nJune 2020 \n\n \n\n\n'
