Rule-based expert systems, blackboard architecture, and\nagent-based.  Knowledge  acquisition  and  representation.  Uncertainty  and  conflict  resolution.  Reasoning  and\nexplanation. Design of intelligent systems. Project. Lectures: three hours per week. Laboratory: two hours per\nweek.\n\n(COMP  6741): Knowledge  representation  and  reasoning.  Uncertainty  and  conflict  resolution.  Design  of\nintelligent systems. Grammar-based, rule-based, and blackboard architectures. A project is required. Laboratory:\ntwo hours per week.\n\nPrerequisite Knowledge\nYou must be familiar with programming in an object-oriented language, such as Java or Python (we will provide a\nbrief introduction to Python as part of the first lab session). Previous knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and/or Machine Learning (ML) is helpful, but\nnot required.\n\nObjectives\nThe goal of this course is to become familiar with modern \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent\xe2\x80\x9d (Artificial Intelligence, AI)-based software\nsystems, that is, software that incorporates algorithms or methods from one of the fields mentioned above (AI,\nML, NLP, IR), in whole or part. Compared to other courses introducing these concepts, this IS course places a\nstronger emphasis on the overall design, implementation and evaluation of a complete AI application. \n\nGeneral Information\nThis course has weekly lectures and lab sessions. For each week, lecture slides will be made available through the\ncourse Moodle web site. Additionally, pre-recorded lectures will be published on Moodle for each week. That is,\nlecture recordings are available in an asynchronous fashion and you can go through them on your own schedule. \n\nFor most lectures, worksheets will be provided that you must go through while following the lecture material. You\nshould then post your answers on Moodle to receive feedback (detailed instructions will be provided on Moodle).\n\nAdditional online activities and office hours will also be announced and scheduled on Moodle.\n\nTextbook\nThere is no single textbook for this course; readings for each lecture topic will be provided on Moodle. Generally,\nthese readings will be available online or as an electronic resource through the Concordia Library.\n\nCourse Moodle Web Site\nAmendments to this syllabus, if any, as well as other important information will be made available through the\ncourse's Moodle site. The Moodle site also provides additional reading material, as well as discussion forums for\nasking questions on lecture topics, the project, exams, etc. Note that you must be registered for the course to\naccess the Moodle site (there is a one-day delay between registering and receiving Moodle access).\n\n\n\nCOMP 474/6741 Intelligent Systems\nDept. of Computer Science Syllabus \xe2\x80\x93 Winter 2021 Concordia University\nand Software Engineering Page 2 of 4 COMP 474/6741 (4 credits)\n\nEvaluation\nYour grade will  be based on a project, split  into  several project assignments, as well as multiple (3-4) timed\nquizzes on the Moodle platform. The distribution of these deliverables is as follows:\n\n45% Course Project (split into several assignments)\n55% Exams (Online Moodle Quizzes) \n \n\nThere is no standard relationship between percentages and letter grades assigned for this course. In order to pass\nthe course you must receive at least 50% of the overall possible marks.\n\nIf  the  final  exam grade is  greater  than the mid-term exam grade,  then the mid-term will  not  be  counted in\ncalculating the overall grade.\n\nNote: It is your responsibility to adhere to the university\xe2\x80\x99s code of conduct as detailed in the academic calendar.\n\nConditions Specific to Remote Teaching and Assessment\n1 All students are expected to have access to a computer with the following capabilities:\n\n1.a reliable internet connection\n1.b camera and microphone (your computer and/or cellphone)\n\n2 All  students  should  install  VPN  for  remote  desktop  access  to  Concordia  University  computer  labs\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/it/support/connect-from-home.html\nOnce you have VPN connection to Concordia University, you can access all available software in Gina\nCody School labs by following the process described in:\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/support/faq/connect-from-home.html\n\n3 Course specific software: You should install the Python programming language, together with a suitable\nIDE. Further details on the required course software will be available on the course Moodle web site.\n\n4 All students are required to do online, timed exams:\n4.a Exams will be done through Moodle Quiz.\n4.b The exams will  take place during the  lecture time period  on dates that will  be announced on\n\nMoodle at least a week in advance.\n4.c You will be responsible for ensuring appropriate, properly functioning technology (webcam, a\n\nmicrophone, appropriate browser and an ability to download any necessary software, as well as a\nreliable internet connection with a minimum of a 3G connection).\n\n4.d You  will  need  a  quiet  place  within  which  to  take  the  quizzes.  Earplugs  or  noise-canceling\nheadphones that are not connected to a device may also be used to allow you to focus for the\nduration of the exam.\n\n4.e The  course  instructor  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  an  individual  oral  examination  to  verify\nstudent\xe2\x80\x99s response to online exam, project, or assignment questions.\n\n5 Academic Integrity\nViolation  of  the  Academic Code  of  Conduct  in  any form will  be  severely dealt  with.  This  includes\ncopying (even with modifications) of  program segments.  You must  demonstrate  independent  thought\nthrough your submitted work. The Academic Code of Conduct of Concordia University is available at:\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/conduct/academic-integrity.html\n\nIt is expected that during class discussions, in the online forums and in your written assignments you will\ncommunicate constructively and respectfully. Sexist, racist, homophobic, ageist, and ablest expressions\nwill not be tolerated.\n\nAll students must read and sign the Expectations of Originality form and submit the signed copy with their\nassignments and project.\n\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/it/support/connect-from-home.html\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/ginacody/docs/Expectations-of-Originality-Feb14-2012.pdf\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/conduct/academic-integrity.html\nhttp://www.concordia.ca/ctl/digital-teaching/using-moodle/assignments.html\nhttps://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/support/faq/connect-from-home.html\n\n\nCOMP 474/6741 Intelligent Systems\nDept. of Computer Science Syllabus \xe2\x80\x93 Winter 2021 Concordia University\nand Software Engineering Page 3 of 4 COMP 474/6741 (4 credits)\n\nCourse Content and Schedule\nWe will cover the following topic(s) in each week (note that the weekly schedule may be subject to change): \n\n(Week 1)   Introduction to Intelligent Systems\n(Week 2)   Introduction to Knowledge Graphs (RDF)\n(Week 3)   Knowledge Graphs: Vocabularies & Ontologies (RDFS, OWL)\n(Week 4)   Knowledge Base Queries (SPARQL)\n(Week 5)   Linked Open Data (LOD) & Applications\n(Week 6)   Personalization & Recommender Systems\n(Week 7)   Introduction to Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems\n(Week 8)   Mid-term break\n(Week 9)   Intelligent Agents: Chatbots & Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n(Week 10) NLP Applications & Text Mining\n(Week 11) Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks\n(Week 12) Deep Learning for Intelligent Systems\n(Week 13) Intelligent System Architectures and Applications\n(Week 14) Conclusions \n\nThere will not be time to cover all of these topics in-depth.
