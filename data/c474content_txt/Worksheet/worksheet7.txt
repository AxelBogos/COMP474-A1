What kind of question would you expect a Concordia Chatbot to be able to handle?\n\n1. For new students (not currently registered at Concordia):\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n2. For current students (already enrolled at Concordia):\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTask 2. Write a regular expression that matches different variations of naming https://www.wikidata.org/\nwiki/Q326342: \xe2\x80\x9cConcordia\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cConcordia U.\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cCU\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cConcordia University\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cUniversite\xcc\x81 Concordia\xe2\x80\x9d, . . . :\n\nTest it at https://regex101.com/\n\nTask 3. Suppose we want to use an existing set of 1000 questions for training a ML classifier. If we use tf-idf\nvectors to represent each question, how many dimensions will the vectors have (make a rough estimate)?\n\nTask 4. Ok, here is an (extremely simplified) idea of creating 2D feature vectors out of a natural language\nquestion: The first dimension a encodes the first occurrence of a question word (see table below) and the\nsecond dimension b the number of Capital Letters in the sentence:\n\nContains? Value\n\nWho 1\n\nWhat 2\n\nWhere 3\n\n(none) 0\n\n# Question a b Class\n\n1 Where is Concordia? Location\n\n2 Who was Steve Jobs? Definition\n\n3 What city is McGill in? Location\n\n4 What is NLP? Definition\n\nTask 5. Using the online parser at https://corenlp.run/, create a parse tree for the sentence What is McGill?.\xc3\x8f\nNote that you can now extract the subject of the sentence, e.g., to plug it into a SPARQL query.\n\nTask 6. Now apply the kNN classification algorithm on the new question below to classify its type. Use\nk = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =\n\n\xe2\x88\x9a\xe2\x88\x91n\ni=1(pi \xe2\x88\x92 qi)2:\n\n# Question a b d-Q1 d-Q2 d-Q3 d-Q4 Class?\n\n5 What is McGill?\n\nYou can now match the new question with a corresponding SPARQL template to obtain a query for your\nknowledge graph, filling in variables with the values extracted from the question.\n\nTask 7. For the questions in Task 1 above, which of the chatbot techniques covered so far would be able to\nanswer them?\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342\nhttps://regex101.com/\nhttps://corenlp.run/\n\n'
