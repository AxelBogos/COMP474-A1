Quick refresher: How do you select all triples in a graph using SPARQL?\n\nSELECT . . .\n\nWHERE {\n\n. . .\n\n}\n\nTask 2. Now for something slightly different: Can you write a SPARQL query that selects all the\nproperties that were declared in a graph?\n\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\n\nSELECT ?property\n\nWHERE {\n\n. . .\n\n}\n\nThis is an example for a query that\xe2\x80\x99s useful during development, to show or test the metadata of a\ngraph.\n\nTask 3. Find the URI for Miyuri Samarasinghe in both DBpedia and Wikidata. What\xe2\x80\x99s a major\xc3\x8f\ndifference between the two graphs? And what is the technical reason for it?\n\nTask 4. Wikidata also has a public SPARQL query interface, located at https://query.wikidata.org/.\xc3\x8f\nYou previously found the URI for Concordia in Wikidata. Now, try to write a SPARQL query that\nreturns the city (URI, name) for Concordia from Wikidata:\n\nSELECT ?city ?cityname\n\nWHERE {\n\n. . .\n\n}\n\nhttps://query.wikidata.org/\n\n\nCOMP474/6741 Worksheet: Knowledge Base Design & Applications Winter 2021\n\nTask 5. Create a competency question and a corresponding SPARQL query for our FOCU university\nexample to check whether every student is a person:\n\nTesting query:\n\nSELECT . . .\n\nWHERE {\n\n. . .\n\n}\n\nTask 6. An early, well-known commercial service for semantic annotation of textual (mostly news)\xc3\x8f\ndocuments was Thompson Reuter\xe2\x80\x99s OpenCalais, which has since been spun out and re-branded as\nRefinitif Intelligent Tagging : Try out the online demo at https://permid.org/onecalaisViewer on a\ndocument, for example the first part of the Wikipedia article on Concordia. Look at the entities that\nwere detected and go to the \xe2\x80\x9cRDF view\xe2\x80\x9d: what ID is given to Concordia in this knowledge graph?\n\nHint: There is another tool at the top of the page, Entity Search, where you can cross-check your\nentities.\n\nTask 7. Go to the DBpedia Spotlight online demo at https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/demo/.\xc3\x8f\nTry analyzing a test document with some ambiguities, e.g, \xe2\x80\x9cParis Hilton went to the Hilton in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\nInspect the entities that were linked to DBpedia. Are they correct?\n\nTask 8. Using Google\xe2\x80\x99s Structured Data Testing Tool,1 examine your favorite movie on IMDB.2\xc3\x8f\n1. Which vocabulary is used to model the movie information?\n\n2. Find the corresponding vocabulary definition online:\n\nTask 9. Find an article online, let\xe2\x80\x99s say from the always trustworthy Mtl Blog.3 Look at the HTML\xc3\x8f\nsource in your browser and find the META tags. Identify entries used by Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s Open Graph\nProtocol.\n\nNow try running the same article through W3C\xe2\x80\x99s RDFa 1.1 Distiller and Parser at https://www.\nw3.org/2012/pyRdfa/. Choose Turtle format and compare the triples linking the article using\nFacebook\xe2\x80\x99s OGP.\n\n1Try https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool or its coming replacement, Google Rich Results Test at\nhttps://search.google.com/test/rich-results\n\n2https://www.imdb.com\n3https://www.mtlblog.com\n\nhttps://permid.org/onecalaisViewer\nhttps://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/demo/\nhttps://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/\nhttps://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/\nhttps://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool\nhttps://search.google.com/test/rich-results\nhttps://www.imdb.com\nhttps://www.mtlblog.com\n\n'
