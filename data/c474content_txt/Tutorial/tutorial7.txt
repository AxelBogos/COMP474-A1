b'COMP474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2021)Worksheet #7: Intelligent AgentsTask 1. What kind of question would you expect a Concordia Chatbot to be able to handle?1. For new students (not currently registered at Concordia):\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa22. For current students (already enrolled at Concordia):\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2Task 2. Write a regular expression that matches different variations of naming https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342: \xe2\x80\x9cConcordia\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cConcordia U.\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cCU\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cConcordia University\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cUniversite\xcc\x81 Concordia\xe2\x80\x9d, . . . :Test it at https://regex101.com/Task 3. Suppose we want to use an existing set of 1000 questions for training a ML classifier. If we use tf-idfvectors to represent each question, how many dimensions will the vectors have (make a rough estimate)?Task 4. Ok, here is an (extremely simplified) idea of creating 2D feature vectors out of a natural languagequestion: The first dimension a encodes the first occurrence of a question word (see table below) and thesecond dimension b the number of Capital Letters in the sentence:Contains? ValueWho 1What 2Where 3(none) 0# Question a b Class1 Where is Concordia? Location2 Who was Steve Jobs? Definition3 What city is McGill in? Location4 What is NLP? DefinitionTask 5. Using the online parser at https://corenlp.run/, create a parse tree for the sentence What is McGill?.\xc3\x8fNote that you can now extract the subject of the sentence, e.g., to plug it into a SPARQL query.Task 6. Now apply the kNN classification algorithm on the new question below to classify its type. Usek = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =\xe2\x88\x9a\xe2\x88\x91ni=1(pi \xe2\x88\x92 qi)2:# Question a b d-Q1 d-Q2 d-Q3 d-Q4 Class?5 What is McGill?You can now match the new question with a corresponding SPARQL template to obtain a query for yourknowledge graph, filling in variables with the values extracted from the question.Task 7. For the questions in Task 1 above, which of the chatbot techniques covered so far would be able toanswer them?1.2.3.https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342https://regex101.com/https://corenlp.run/'
