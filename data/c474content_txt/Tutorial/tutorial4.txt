Quick refresher: How do you select all triples in a graph using SPARQL?SELECT . . .WHERE {. . .}Task 2. Now for something slightly different: Can you write a SPARQL query that selects all theproperties that were declared in a graph?PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>SELECT ?propertyWHERE {. . .}This is an example for a query that\xe2\x80\x99s useful during development, to show or test the metadata of agraph.Task 3. Find the URI for Miyuri Samarasinghe in both DBpedia and Wikidata. What\xe2\x80\x99s a major\xc3\x8fdifference between the two graphs? And what is the technical reason for it?Task 4. Wikidata also has a public SPARQL query interface, located at https://query.wikidata.org/.\xc3\x8fYou previously found the URI for Concordia in Wikidata. Now, try to write a SPARQL query thatreturns the city (URI, name) for Concordia from Wikidata:SELECT ?city ?citynameWHERE {. . .}https://query.wikidata.org/COMP474/6741 Worksheet: Knowledge Base Design & Applications Winter 2021Task 5.

Look at the entities thatwere detected and go to the \xe2\x80\x9cRDF view\xe2\x80\x9d: what ID is given to Concordia in this knowledge graph?Hint: There is another tool at the top of the page, Entity Search, where you can cross-check yourentities.Task 7. Go to the DBpedia Spotlight online demo at https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/demo/.\xc3\x8fTry analyzing a test document with some ambiguities, e.g, \xe2\x80\x9cParis Hilton went to the Hilton in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9dInspect the entities that were linked to DBpedia. Are they correct?Task 8. Using Google\xe2\x80\x99s Structured Data Testing Tool,1 examine your favorite movie on IMDB.2\xc3\x8f1. Which vocabulary is used to model the movie information?2. Find the corresponding vocabulary definition online:Task 9.
