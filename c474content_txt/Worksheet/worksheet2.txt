Quick refresher: Using the N-Triples serialization format, write an RDF triple describing the\xc3\x8f\ncity Concordia is location in:\n\nTask 2. Define the fact that Student is a class (as opposed to an instance, like Jane). Use\nTurtle format with the following prefix definitions and define Student as part of the ex namespace\n(ex:Student):\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .\n\nAdd the triple:\n\nand draw the resulting graph:\n\nTask 3. Now add another triple stating that Jane (ex:jane#me) is of type ex:Student:\n\nand add it to the graph above.\n\nTask 4. It is good practice to give every IRI a human-readable label (where appropriate). Add two\nrdfs:label triples (in English and French) for \xe2\x80\x9cStudent\xe2\x80\x9d:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n(Similarly, you would define an rdfs:comment to explain what it means to be a student.)\n\nTask 5. For now at least, every Student is a Person (sorry, robots!). Define this fact as a triple and\nadd it to your graph above:\n\n\n\nCOMP474/6741 Worksheet: Vocabularies & Ontologies Winter 2021\n\nTask 6. Ok, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at these three triples (written in pseudocode for brevity):\n\n<LS-210> <teaches> <COMP472/6721> .\n\n<professor> <is a> <slide> .\n\n<student> <handed in by> <assignment> .\n\nAre these syntactically legal triples? (Spoiler alert: yes, we could write each of them using perfectly fine\nRDF URIs.) So what exactly is wrong here?\n\nTask 7. We now define a property, studiesAt, so that we can indicate at which university a student is\nstudying. Write the triple defining studiesAt as a property (again using the ex: namespace):\n\n(Note: properties should also have labels & comments, but we omit this here.)\n\nTask 8. We now have to add domain and range restrictions for our property to avoid problems like the\nones in Task 6 above. For the domain of our studiesAt property, we only permit ex:Student resources\nand for the range, we only admit ex:University resources. Write the two triples:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nTask 9. A widely used vocabulary for describing people and their (social) networks is Friend-of-a-Friend\xc3\x8f\n(FOAF), which you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen before:\n\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\n\n1. Assume Joe has a photo of him published under http://facebook.me/joe.png (not a real URL).\nHow can you add this information to the knowledge graph using FOAF (hint: look up the vocabu-\nlary using the prefix URL above):\n\n2. Again using FOAF, model that Jane is 22 years old:\n\n\n'
